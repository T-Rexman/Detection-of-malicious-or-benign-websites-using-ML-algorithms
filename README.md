Project Description:

The primary goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately classify websites as either malicious or benign using machine learning algorithms.
This system will help in identifying potentially harmful websites, thereby protecting users from online threats such as phishing attacks, malware, and data breaches.
In today's world, the number of websites is rapidly increasing, along with the threats they may pose. Detecting malicious websites manually is time-consuming and inefficient. The use of machine learning not only automates this process but also improves accuracy through continuous learning.
The system uses a dataset of websites with labels indicating whether they are malicious or benign. The machine learning model is trained on this data to make accurate predictions based on features such as URL patterns, domain information, and content analysis.
Features:

• The system will allow the administrator to upload website datasets containing labeled malicious and benign websites.
• The machine learning model will be trained using supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines (SVM).
• Users can input website URLs to check if they are malicious or benign. The system will output a prediction along with a probability score indicating the confidence level of the prediction.
• The system will allow the addition of new data to continuously improve the model's performance through re-training.
• A detailed log of classified websites will be maintained, including the date and time of classification and the features used for prediction.
• Users can also view a summary of the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Note:
For the project to run, it requires a stable internet connection and access to the machine learning model’s training data.

How to set up and run the project:

1. Install the required libraries using pip install.
2. Run the app.py to get a dedicated url of the development server for the flask app.
3. Follow the link url provided in the terminal.
4. Upload the dataset into the system's database.
5. Train the machine learning model using the dataset.
6. Start the application and input website URLs to detect their status (malicious or benign).
